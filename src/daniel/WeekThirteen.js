            Thankfully, we finished our project on time, and throughout the entire semester, I learnt several Unity techniques for creating 2D down-top view games. Uncertainty would be the game feature of our product, which is difficult to implement but which we did. In a darker setting, the level is more challenging and eerie due to the randomization of the chambers, and when we perish, we face different problems. We had to abandon many of our brilliant ideas due to time constraints, including adding more game features and player talents as well as other enemy concepts. After the course, I'll keep coming up with these ideas rather than giving up. </p>

            From the lecture, I learned advanced knowledge of how to create a high quilty game, such as how to design and layout a good-level design. how to place the challenge, engaging and fun levels which fit into the structure and pace of the game. All these ideas learned from the lecture and critiques are implemented into our project to enhance our gameplayer experience. Through this project, I was also able to practise and learn how to code in Unity effectively, which will be incredibly useful if I ever manage to land a position in the gaming industry. My understanding of the functions and Unity's built-in capabilities, as well as how to write C# scripts to add features to games, has improved as a result of the development process for this project. Additionally, by repeatedly writing the script and practising coding, I learned how to detect colliders, use the awake, start, and update functions in the script, and grasp the majority of the syntax that I could use when creating the game.
