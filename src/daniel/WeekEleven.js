            I had implemented a main menu, intro menu and pause menu for the game.  The main menu will have a character in the center of the scene and button below of the scene and can be press to intro menu. The intro menu will have an instruction of player control and also have a button to enter the main game scene. In the pause menu, I created a basic pause menu that we can activate deactivate using the escape key. Further, I had extended the pause menu and add the ability to adjust the music and sound effect volume levels using buttons.</p>

                For the next week, I will improve our overview map and adding the teleport function to our player in order to let our player to tp the room that they had explored.
