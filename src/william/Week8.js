	<h2>Week Eight</h2>
	<h3>2022, Nov 3rd</h3>

	<p>
	In this week, I started creating sprites for the enemies. 
	Since we wanted to stick with the theme of Japanese mythology and demons, 
I got most of my inspirations from https://yokai.com/, a wikipedia full of good and bad demons of Japan.
This week, I created a basic monster that would be residing in the 2nd level of the game, inspired from a demon named “Take-Take”.
The name originates from an onomatopoeia that resembles a pair of hand crawling on the hand. 
This is because the demon is a long haired woman with missing legs that crawls around, hunting the weak at night.
I thought this demon would be a perfect addition to our game since it matches the theme, and by adding eery sound we can add suspense into the game.
For enemy sprites, I decided to only do 4-direction sprites to save time, to work on other artifacts.
