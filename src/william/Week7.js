		In week 7, I continued to create sprites for the main character and ideating enemies for the further levels. 
I created a dash animation for all 8-directions, and a death animation for the main character. 
This took up most of my time this week, as I wanted to make the dust particle behind the character after his dashes feel premium and smooth. 
This was a fun experience as I wasnâ€™t struggle as much to figure out the right perspective for the sprite, and just drawing and testing if it looks nice. 
In conclusion, I was pretty satisfied with the outcome this week. In the extra time, I reviewed and watched tutorials on youtube how to create effective motion and sprites on Aesprite.
