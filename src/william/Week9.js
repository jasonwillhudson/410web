		In this week, I mostly focused on hosting play tests at my home, documenting it, and receiving feedback.
The feedback was relayed to the team on our weekly meetings, and we considered them on how to change our game.
 A lot of the feedbacks were issues that we were aware of, but features that we haven’t been able to implement because our developers have been very busy.
Aside from that, we were able to find loop holes, edge cases, and glitches during this time. For example, sometimes the game would enter an edge case where a player can enter a pitch dark room, with no walls nor enemies.
This was interesting to see and I thought it could somehow fit into our game’s story, but it had to be fixed as it was too game break. Inspired from this though, I was able to get some ideas of how to creatively tell a story within a game. 
Not just in a frame that we made, but in a unexpected way as well where the players would have to be bold and daring to explore risking their one life.
