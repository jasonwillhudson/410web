        <h2>Week Thirteen</h2>
        <h3>2022, Dec 8th</h3>

        <p> This is the last week, and as much as I wanted to create more of my own sprites into the game, I could not.
 For the last week, while I waited on the developers to polish the game into a gold code, I documented our process and the final report of the game.
I also helped testing the last bit of the game, split works among the non-developers, and give moral support to the developers. We all know they are suffering inside.
Big thanks to my team and the teaching team of 410 for the great semester, I hope you enjoy our game.
