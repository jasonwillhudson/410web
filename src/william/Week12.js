        <p> We are finally near the end of the project. Due to time constraint and lack of it, we decided to use 3rd party sprites for the weapon, boss and couple of enemies.
Some were sprites created by our team on their past project. However, there were still other sprites to make, the tutorial page. 
Considering the game, the controls are not hard but there are features that are not obvious to the new users. I had to make a control schematic page the players are able to open when they need help.
I wanted it to be a moving image, as well as fit in to the theme of the game. Over the span of 10~15 frames, I created a control schematic that features a WASD for moving, a Mouse for aiming, Left button click for attacking, Right button click for dashing, TAB for opening the map, and finally it shows that if they press on a room on the map, they are able to fast travel to that location as long the room was cleared by the player previously.
