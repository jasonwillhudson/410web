        <h2>Week Four</h2>
        <h3>2022, Oct 6th</h3>

        <p>For week 3, we worked on the GDD.  I took the initiative to work on the narrative for the game and its narrative flowboard. We had the basic story of the game ideated, but needed details of our protagonist and antagonist and the village the game would take place in. I focused on the possible variation of the Yokai and decided to go with a dark story which would go with the gameplay. We decided to make our story compelling by adding the twist that the Yokai antagonist Yami would be a single entity that possesses our protagonists family, villagers and comrades. All of the gameplay that would happen in the village of Mitsuda where the Japanese Samurai protagonist Higari has been training his weapon arts while residing in the outskirts of the village. His name would be derived from the Japaese translation of Light and would boast weapons such as the Katana, Glaive, Ninja stars, and many others with the skills to use them. Our antagonist name Yami will be derived from the Japanese translation of Darkness, which is the opposite of Higari and would pose as the shadow figure (Kage) of the protagonist Yami. The strange phenomenon that would occur at Mitsuda will be uncovered later in the story as Yami progresses to find out more about the powerful Yokai. This way we can add chests, ability to upgrade weapons and skills which would later be used to face more powerful demons in the game. It adds suspense and horror as he discovers the demons he fought were his own people being possessed by the Yokai's minions. He has to use upgrades and skills to kill the demons and not his own people.</p>
