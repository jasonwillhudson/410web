        <h2>Week Two</h2>
        <h3>2022, Sep 22nd</h3>
        <p>After ideation and planning on week 1, I have taken the role of programming and artist because of my previous
            experience in developing games. Week 2 went by without a lot of contribution from me. I am slowly starting
            my way around Unity and Japanese mythology. I'm not well taught on mythology but I find it really
            interesting. Personally researching on character and appearance to suite the characteristics of the Yokai, a
            class of supernatural entity in Japanese folklore.</p>
