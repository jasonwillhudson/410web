        <h2>Week One</h2>
        <h3>2022, Sep 15th</h3>
        <p>During our meetings, due to my vast experience in games (rogue-likes especially because that is one of my
            favourite types of games), I suggested many ideas that we could bring into our game taking inspiration from
            other games like Hades. Because I had a lot of gaming experience, I decided that the Game Designer role
            would fit me. As for the Programming role, I had some experience developing games but not in Unity, however
            I did want to learn how to produce games with a well-known game engine like Unity.</p>
