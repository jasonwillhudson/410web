        <h2>Week Four</h2>
        <h3>2022, Oct 6th</h3>

        <p>During week 4, I participated and provided a lot of ideas in our ideation. As a game designer as well as a gamer, I had a lot of ideas to present with inspirations from different games. A fellow team member, William, and I thought of most of the new ideas from other games like 20 Minutes Till Dawn and League of Legends. After our ideation session, I feel proud of the potential that our game has, between the variation of mechanics to even the environmental mechanics such as light and sound.</p>
        <p>Especially when ideating monster sprites, we took the creative liberty of using resources within a yokai encyclopedia and incorporating it into our game lore, giving our game the creepy Japanese aesthetics that we wanted. One of the yokais we found was the Teke Teke, which is the sound of the monster walking on her hands, essentially crawling. We thought that this was perfect for our gameâ€™s aesthetics since our setting is in a village and this yokai is a creepy crawling lady with a sickle in her hands.</p>
        <p>The main concern I have for our game as of the moment is the amount of workload because of the huge potential our game has. We can always cut out some ideas we have made since they are all just options for us to implement, but I want to ensure the core mechanics that make our game different get implemented.</p>
