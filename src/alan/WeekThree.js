        <h2>Week Three</h2>
        <h3>2022, Sep 29th</h3>

        <p>This week I have covered the Gameplay Mode, Interaction Model, Core Gameplay, Winning Play, and Smart Depth Analysis on the GDD as well as the character backgrounds of the main character. For our core gameplay, we have it modelled to a simple hack and slash type of game where you would kill monsters and have the incentive of killing more with weapon and character upgrades. Therefore our target player type are killers as well as explorers as we intend to have players explore many combinations of upgrades the game would provide. As for our winning play, our game is going to have a typical rogue-like winning play where you defeat the final boss and you win the runthrough. Additionally we could implement an endless mode where it would loop the runthrough content but with higher stats.</p>
        <p>As for the story, I am ensuring the story we will have in the end does not stray from our original ideas as we think our ideas will stand out in the game even if the game is targeted mainly towards hard fun gameplay.</p>
