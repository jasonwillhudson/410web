        <h2>Week Thirteen</h2>
        <h3>2022, Dec 8th</h3>

        <p>From this project, I really learned a lot about developing a 2D top-down game in Unity, not only from all the tutorials I watched but also from the experience I gained in coding the whole project from scratch with Unity. From the lecture and critiques, I learned a lot about the factors we should consider when designing the game. I always try to implement the game design knowledge I learned through the semester inside of this project, which helps me to build critical thinking when creating the level design, mechanism, game process flow and visual elements. </p>

        <p>This semester has been a busy semester since it is my last one, and I do not really have much time to spend polishing the final project. But I feel very proud of myself that Daniel and I build the whole game from scratch and implemented most of the features we mentioned at the beginning of the semester. Through this project, I also learned and practice how to efficiently debug the code with the log in Unity, which could be very helpful for my work in the future if I could get a job in a game company. The development process during this project also helps me to master the functions and built-in features that we could use in the unity and how to write the script in C# to create the features we need in the game. Moreover, from writing the script and practice on coding, again and again, I learned about how to detect colliders, and the functionality of awake, start and update works in the script and mastered most of the syntax that I could use in developing the game.  </p>
