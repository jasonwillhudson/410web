        <h2>Week One</h2>
        <h3>2022, Sep 11th</h3>
        <p>In first week, I participated in brainstorming the ideas for the game and I contributed in the discussion to
            provide advice based on my past gaming experience. In the proposal, I mainly contributed in the idea of
            background story and how the mechanism could be. Since I have past experience on Unity, I take the role of
            programmer. The role of artist also fits me as I had ability on drawing and sketching, and I would like to
            help on creating spirits later. </p>
