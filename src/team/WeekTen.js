            During week 10, we are focused on making our levels more engaging and completing our third level. Since our enemy archetypes are lacking, we decided to put more of our focus on the bosses of each level. We made the boss on level 1 have one unique skill, level 2 with two unique skills, and the final level with three unique skills. 
        </p>
        <p>
            We completed a few more enemy sprites that will be characterized as different enemy types. Since we still do not have a ranged enemy, we made it an enemy with different stats and visual effects. We also added more sound effects to make the enemies more engaging such as a screeching sound effect when the floating head enemy is chasing after the player.
