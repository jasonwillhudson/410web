        <p>
            During Week 7, we added more presets to the maps which increases the randomness of the levels per playthrough. This will add more replayability and increase the playerâ€™s interest levels. For our ideation, we still need to implement the wisp features and the upgrade features that will enhance our game, however we are unsure if we have time to work on it since we are always occupied by course documentation.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some of our sprites are still in progress, so far we have one sprite that is modeled after the Teketeke yokai. Our artists are working on a floating head yokai sprite that will act as swarmers.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our map now has a minimap implemented. We are planning to add a map button that will show an enlarged version of the minimap and we wanted to add teleporting points that will let the user teleport to rooms that have been explored. This will cut the downtime on the action and keep players engaged.
