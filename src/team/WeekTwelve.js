        <h3>2022, Dec 1st</h3>

        <p>During week 12, we finished refining the boss mechanics finishing off with explosion, bullet rain, and sword rotation mechanics. In addition to that, we decided to make multiple of these boss monsters to further increase the complexity of the game. As players progress through each level, the number of boss mechanics increases by one.

            We also added more scenes that encapsulates the structure of the game. We have added a start menu, restart game menu, a dying scene, and a tutorial at the start of the game.
        </p>

        <p>In the end, we did not have enough time to design the final boss like how we wanted to, as well as implement a lot of other critical features. We wanted to make the final boss be perceived as a shadow version of the main character copying the playerâ€™s stats and upgrades.</p>
