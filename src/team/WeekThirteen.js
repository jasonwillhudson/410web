        <p>For our final project, we did not have enough time to implement all the features that we intend to, for example, using wasps to attack enemies and different buffs or debuff that could be added to the character or monster, but we still made it to a complete game that player can have fun with. In the future, we could add more features to make the game much more fun such as variant monsters and mechanisms of depuff such as poisoned, slow down, stun, etc. Since we did not have much time on designing the map layout and looks. The map might look a little bit repetitive throughout the level right now so it has a lot of potentials to improve with. Moreover, in the beginning, we proposed to make the player has a different kind of weapon which is also the part that we could build in the future. Right now, our game only has a regular attack with a sword and the player might get bored after playing it for a while. The skill and weapon system also has lots of potentials to dig in if we have more time. </p>

        <p>Even though our project is not perfect and has a lot of parts to improve on, it is still a fun game to play with. We tried our best so there has nothing to regret about. One thing we could improve on is distributing the work more evenly and planning ahead of time so that we might be able to work more efficiently as a team and implement more features before the deadline. </p>
