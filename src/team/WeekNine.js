            Unfortunately we did not do much during week 9 due to critiques and other course work. We have learned from playtests that we need to improve our enemy complexity as we lack a lot of enemy archetypes and include more tutorials on the control schemes. One issue we had was that players did not know about the teleporting feature on the map. They only knew of it after we told them.        
        </p>
        <p>
            Due to the playtests, our artists are working on tutorial sprites for displaying the controls such as the player movement being the standard ‘WASD’ and slashing being the left mouse button.        
        </p>
        <p>
            Reflecting back, our progress in making these features took more time than expected. We are going to have to cut out features like the wisp, weapon upgrades, and weapon types.
