            During week 8, we improved our sword swinging animation making it look more like a swift swing with more power. We also worked on more feedback effects such as a heart-breaking visual effect when the player takes damage, as well as blood splatter effects when slashing enemies.
        </p>
        <p>
            We also implemented sustainability features such as potions for health recovery. These potions can be dropped by chance when killing enemies. In addition to that, we added a weapon upgrade item that will increase the playerâ€™s attack damage. These attack damage increase items are found in treasure rooms in the levels.
