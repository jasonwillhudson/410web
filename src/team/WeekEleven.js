        <h3>2022, Nov 24th</h3>

        <p>Looking at feedback, we found that we have a lot of elements that made the game feel better such as the feedback elements that subconsciously notified players of the game situation. We also saw that the players liked the ambient sound effects as well as new boss mechanics to make the game more engaging. Additional note, playtesters appreciated that different enemy types had their own death animations.</p>
        <p>As for the boss sprites and animations, due to lack of time, we could not design our own assets. Therefore we used some online assets that somewhat fits the Japanese mythological theme. One of the boss sprites we added was a skeleton structured snake that has the ability to shoot projectiles.</p>
