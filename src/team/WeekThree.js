        <h2>Week Three</h2>
        <h3>2022, Sep 29th</h3>

        <p>During week 3, we had refined our GDD which solidified details such as our game lore as well as character backgrounds. We currently have a partially completed story with certain plots that we want to emphasize to make our game intriguing. We will soon complete the core story of our premise. This week we did not have much time to really work on our milestones as we have to focus more on completing our GDD this week.</p>
        <p>The sprites we have completed are the main character with directions and some weapon sprites. We are currently working on the main character’s attack animations. In addition to that, we will work on our room aesthetics in the near future. We also have some assets done according to the GDD.</p>
        <p>For our game, we have finished implementing the player controls and the map note graphs completed using old assets for our prototype. We plan to add more note graphs for “randomized” room combinations and add our own map assets for the Japanese Village aesthetic. The player can also transition through the rooms of the map just like in games like The Binding of Isaac or Enter the Gungeon. We also have attack combos for the character weapons coming soon.</p>
