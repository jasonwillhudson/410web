        <h2>Week Two</h2>
        <h3>2022, Sep 22nd</h3>
        <p>During week 2, not a lot of progress has been achieved as we are still in the setting up phase for our game. We currently have some team members research on how to work with Unity and how to implement certain features in our game. Such features include player movement and player controls. We want to code our player model to move in the eight cardinal directions for a smoother gaming experience. An example of this player movement would be from The Binding of Isaac where players are able to move horizontally, vertically, as well as diagonally.</p>
        <p>What we have at the moment are the player controls bound to keys and animations working according to the player movement. However we encountered a bug where we could not get the player to traverse. We plan to fix this bug at least by the end of next week if not earlier.</p>
        <p>In terms of art progress. We have our main character player model art designed and we plan to expand his animations further. As for the map design, we have some artists working on the aesthetics of the map and eventually the layout as well. </p>
        <p>Our next steps in terms of aesthetics is to design the monsters the players will be fighting. Since we plan on making the monsters based on Japanese mythology, we thought of making the models with inspiration from creepy Japanese horror games, especially when it fits the old village in the midst of the night aesthetic.</p>
